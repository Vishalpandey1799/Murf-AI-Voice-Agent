# 🎙️ Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge – Day 1 to 5 Progress

Welcome to my journey through the **Murf AI Voice Agent 30-Day Challenge**!  
I'm building a smart and interactive **voice agent** using Murf AI's powerful TTS capabilities and integrating it with real-time tech like **AssemblyAI, FastAPI**, and **LLM APIs**.

---

### 🗓️ Day 5 – Audio Upload + Server Integration ☁️

- ⏺️ Extended the Echo Bot to **upload audio to my Python server**
- 🛠️ Built a new `/upload` API in **FastAPI** to:

  - Accept audio blob from frontend
  - Save it in an `/uploads` folder
  - Return file **name**, **type**, and **size**

- 🔔 Added a real-time **status message on UI** after upload
- 🔃 Improved end-to-end interactivity from mic → server → playback
- 🔥 Feels like I’m building the foundation for a real voice assistant!
